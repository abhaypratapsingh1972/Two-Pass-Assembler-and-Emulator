# Two-Pass Assembler and Emulator

## Overview
This project implements a **Two-Pass Assembler** along with an **Emulator** for a simple assembly language.  
The assembler converts assembly programs into machine code using two passes, and the emulator executes the generated machine code step-by-step.

This project was developed as part of the **CS210 Mini Project (2024)** to understand low-level system programming concepts such as symbol tables, instruction encoding, and execution flow.

## Two-Pass Assembler

### Pass 1
- Reads the assembly program line by line
- Assigns addresses to instructions
- Builds the **symbol table** for labels
- Detects syntax errors and undefined symbols

### Pass 2
- Uses the symbol table generated in Pass 1
- Generates **machine code**
- Produces a listing file (`.lst`)
- Logs errors and warnings (`.log`)

---

## Emulator
- Loads the machine code generated by the assembler
- Simulates instruction execution
- Supports arithmetic, data movement, branching, and halt operations
- Displays program execution results and memory state

---

## Sample Assembly Programs
The repository includes multiple `.asm` files such as:
- Addition of numbers
- Multiplication of two numbers
- Array reversal
- Custom algorithm examples

These programs can be assembled and executed using the provided tools.

---

## How to Compile

### Compile the Assembler
```bash
g++ asm1.cpp -o asm1
````

### Compile the Emulator

```bash
g++ emu.cpp -o emu
```

---

## How to Run

### Step 1: Assemble the Program

```bash
./asm1 input.asm
```

This generates:

* `machineCode.o`
* `listfile.lst`
* `logfile.log`

### Step 2: Run the Emulator

```bash
./emu machineCode.o
```
